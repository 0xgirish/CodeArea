django-cleanup automatically deletes files for FileField, ImageField, and subclasses. It will delete
old files when a new file is being saved and it will delete files on model instance deletion.

**Warning! If you use transactions you may lose files if a transaction will rollback at the right
instance. Though this outcome is reduced by our use of post_save and post_delete signals, this
outcome will still occur if there are errors in signals that are handled after our signals are
handled. In this case, the old file will be lost and the new file will not be referenced in a model,
though the new file will likely still exist on disk. If you are concerned about this behavior you
will need another solution for old file deletion in your project. This is fixed in Django 1.9+ if
you are using a database that supports transactions.**

Features
========

- Support for Django 1.8, 1.11, 2.0
- Python 2.7 and 3.4+ support
- Compatible with sorl-thumbnail and easy-thumbnail

How does it work?
=================

django-cleanup connects post_init, pre_save, post_save, and post_delete signals to signal handlers
for each model that has a FileField and which app is listed in INSTALLED_APPS. In order to tell
whether or not a FileField's value has changed a local cache of original values is kept on the model
instance.

Installation
============
::

    pip install django-cleanup


Configuration
=============

Add django_cleanup to settings.py ::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'django_cleanup',
    )

Signals
=======

django-cleanup sends the following signals which can be imported from `django_cleanup.signals`:

- **cleanup_pre_delete** just before a file is deleted. Passes a `file` keyword argument.
- **cleanup_post_delete** just after a file is deleted. Passes a `file` keyword argument.

Signals example for sorl.thumbnail
----------------------------------
::

    from django_cleanup.signals import cleanup_pre_delete, cleanup_post_delete

    def sorl_delete(**kwargs):
        from sorl.thumbnail import delete
        delete(kwargs['file'])

    cleanup_pre_delete.connect(sorl_delete)

Refresh from DB
===============
In Django 1.8, after a call to the method **refresh_from_db**, you will also need to refresh the
cleanup cache on the instance. This is not required in Django 1.10+.
::

    from django_cleanup import cleanup

    ...

    instance.refresh_from_db()
    cleanup.refresh(instance)
    ...


How to run tests
================
::

    tox
