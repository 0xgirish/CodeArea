\section{Forms}
The Forms Module manages the process of accepting input from the user, and then processing and responding to the input. Major functions performed by the module are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Preparing and restructuring data to make it ready for rendering
	\item Creating HTML forms for the data
	\item Receiving and processing submitted forms and data from the client
	\item Perform validation checks before saving the data to the database
\end{itemize}

\section{Views}
A view takes a Web request and returns a Web response. This response can be the HTML contents of a Web page, or a redirect, or a 404 error, or an XML document, or an image . . . or anything, really. The view itself contains whatever arbitrary logic is necessary to return that response. The View Module manages all the different views for different pages in the application, all views being their own submodules. All the CRUD operations operate through views.

\section{User Permissions}
Closely related to the Views Module, the User Permissions module manages all the user permissions of the app. User permissions include what all pages a user can view, what all files on the server can the user have access to, etc.
